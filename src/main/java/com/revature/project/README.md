### Employee Reimbursement Ticketing System

The goal of this project is to create a console based program that will have the following user stories:

- Users can log in
- Users can register a new account
- Default account access level is 'Employee'
- Employee accounts can submit new reimbursement tickets
- Employee accounts can view submitted tickets and status
- Default ticket status is 'pending'
- Manager level accounts can view all tickets from all employees
- Manager level accounts can filter by ticket status
- Manager level accounts can approve/deny reimbursement requests
